title: MTM Valuations Enhancements
status: active
type: Project
summary:  Lee Anne continues to work on this project, but it hasn't been her top focus.  She has found a few bugs with the system and is close to making this operational.  I've asked her to put together a complete list of all work that's related to the MTM functionality so we can start scoping out the possible work in its entirety.

Lee Anne is currently working on this.  I will be reviewing the work with her this week to get an update and estimate completion date.

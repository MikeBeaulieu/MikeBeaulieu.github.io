By the end of this week we will have a first version of the complete data model.  That is, the Trade screen will be updating the database with the calculated commissions and fees.  I hope to demo on Friday.

The first reports we are writing are what we call *Scaffold reports* which will help with the testing of the system as well as evaluate the data model as well.

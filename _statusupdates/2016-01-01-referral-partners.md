summary: Demoed with Brad Friday Apr 15 - didn't go smoothly due to bugs.  We discussed a few important topics related to the business rules, namely whether we should charge settlement fees on Forward Deposits.  Bill will continue with the report development this week.

By the end of this week we will have a first version of the complete data model.  That is, the Trade screen will be updating the database with the calculated commissions and fees.  I hope to demo on Friday.

The first reports we are writing are what we call *Scaffold reports* which will help with the testing of the system as well as evaluate the data model as well.

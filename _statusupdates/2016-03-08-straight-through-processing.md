I haven't made too much headway with the overall planning of the project.  But I think the discussions we have had over the last few weeks have helped you get familiar with the project scope.  

I have focused on the changes that are needed to the Beneficiary screen.  The requirements still need to be reviewed once again with Expertus, but I think we can refactor the Beneficiary screen to make it testable before starting on the Expertus phase of the project.
